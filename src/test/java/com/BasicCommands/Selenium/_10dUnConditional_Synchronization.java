		In this we just specify timeout value only. We will make the tool to wait
		until certain amount of time and then proceed further.

		Examples: Wait() and Thread.Sleep();

		The main disadvantage for the above statements are,
		there is a chance of unnecessary waiting time even though the application is ready.

		The advantages are like
		in a situation where we interact for third party systems like interfaces,
		it is not possible to write a condition or check for a condition.
Here in this situations, we have to make the application to wait for certain amount of time by specifying the timeout value.*/
